## TODO

- [x] Add multiple languages
- [x] Add loading spinner to show something is happenning
- [ ] Ability to search for a word and insert an scripture
- [ ] Handle multiple scriptures in a row (for exammple `Ps 83:18; Rev 21:4`)
- [ ] Handle different abbreviations for the Bible books (i. e.: Ps. 83:18; Ps 83:18; Psalms 83:18)
- [ ] Add ability to play a portion of a book or the whole book

## Known Issues

- Spanish scriptures now need to have the scripture as a single word. For example, 1 Cor 1:1 will not work. But
  1Cor 1:1 will GÃ¡l 1:1
